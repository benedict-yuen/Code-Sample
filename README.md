# Overview

The purpose of this repository is to highlight my code and experiences from previous bioinformatics projects that relied on metagenomic data.

## Workflows  
Each workflow has its own README with detailed instructions. Click on the links below for more information:  

- **[Method 1: Symbiont Metagenomes](metagenomics/README.md)** – Symbiont MAG recovery workflow including assembly, binning, classification, QC, phylogenomic analysis  
- **[Method 2: Lucinid Mitochondrial Genomes](mitochondrial_genomics/README.md)** – Host mitochondrial genome recovery and functional annotation
- **[Method 3: Symbiont Genome Recombination](genome_recombination_analysis/README.md)** – Symbiont MAG alignment, core gene extraction, recombination analysis 
- **[Differential Expression (DE) Analysis](Differential_Expression/README.md)** - Scripts for DE analysis using **DESeq2**
- **[WGCNA Co-Expression Analysis](Differential_Expression/README.md)** - Unsupervised network analysis to identify correlated gene modules, extract functional insights, and explore complex expression patterns in omics datasets.
